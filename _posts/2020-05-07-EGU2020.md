# Sharing Geoscience Online
In response to Covid19 pandemic, EGU2020 has decided to go virtual via the [<b>Sharing Geoscience Online</b>](https://egu2020.eu/sharing_geoscience_online/sharing_geoscience_online.html) experiment.
The experiment embraces the main [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) principles replacing software with science **free and open science!**

Abstracts and presentation materials are available online. Discussion is promoted via the public commenting option. Video links were not permitted but live, inter-active text-based session chat channels are organized for each individual session.

There is a tonne of information one can find 
on the event [EGU2020 website](https://www.egu2020.eu/).

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Note:</b> I have never participated in such event. Now, I do have the opportunity to get first contact with the atmosphere. This is just awesome!</div>
<br>



# Grabbing the opportunity
**Why?** 
- to communicate about science to general public 

**What?**
- to attend one of the live text-based sessions

**How?**
- aggregate the session public information 
- produce representative visuals and/or takeaway points
- practice public communication



# Geodesy at EGU2020
At EGU2020, <b>Geodesy (G)</b> discipline is divived in six main meeting themes:

- G1 – Geodetic Theory and Algorithms 
- G2 – Reference Frames and Geodetic Observing Systems 
- G3 – Geodynamics and Earth Fluids 
- G4 – Satellite Gravimetry, Gravity and Magnetic Field Modeling 
- G5 – Geodetic Monitoring of the Atmosphere 
- G6 – General Sessions

Each group includes 3 to 6 topical sessions.


On Wednesday evening, I joined session G3.2 [Observing geophysical signals in the Climate and Earth System through Geodesy](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/displays/35331). 
​

There were 150+ active users enrolled in the discussion chat. Coordination was lively and constructive. I found the session intensive, interactive and inspiring. 
​

With these goodies in my mood, I decided to have also some fun with [python](https://www.python.org/) and **exploratory analysis** in a [Jupyther notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 
​

This is the outcome and I gladly share it with you in the EGU's spirit of **#shareEGU20**.



# G3.2: quick numbers
Session G3.2 included **31** displays, from which **20** uploaded presentation materials. <br>
The displays accounted work from **153** authors.




# Top words from the titles
The word summary from the titles gives a quick indication what authors aimed to promote this year. Are these words significant and representative for the session?

The top 5 most frequent words in the display titles are:

```
data, water, storage, global, GRACE
```


Bear in mind that <code>change</code> and <code>change<b>s</b></code> are considered two separate words here. I did not spend time to figure out how to handle plurals or third form of the verbs. We live with this aspect for now.

# Wordcloud from the abstracts
With the above in mind, let's see next how the word frequency looks when looking into the content of the abstracts. The top 10 words in the abstracts looks like:
```
1. water (63)
2. data (60)
3. grace (58)
4. global (45)
5. time (41)
6. mass (38)
7. storage (36)
8. climate (34)
9. observations (33)
10. changes (31)
```

**Water** and **data** switch places this time. <br>
**GRACE** and **global** are still on top 5. <br>
**Time** comes now on 5th. <br>
**Change** breaks into top 5 if we count change and changes as one word. <br>
Insightful, isn't it?


But what about a visual? This is what we get if we translate the frequency numbers into a **wordcloud** visual representation:

Awesome! I posted the wordcloud on Twitter in real-time during the meeting. EGU_Geodesy draw a nice summary statement:

This short blog was derived from the jupyther notebook hosted on github [here](https://github.com/coandrei/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/egu2020/g32.ipynb).

Indeed, an inspiring and fun evening. **Open science is awesome!**. 
<br>Thank you EGU2020!
